          I was asked this just the other day and that statement will be true
          forever.

          My answer is always the same. None and all of them. Quit that zen
          bullshit you say? What I mean to say is to learn programming not languages. But pick a
          language and stick with it at first. There will be temptation, but pick one for
          now. After you have a strong understanding of that language, learning
          others will be so much easier.

				<p>In our situation, the real answer is learn JavaScript. Learn the shit out of it.</p>
				<p>Know that the web is pretty much HTML/CSS/Javascript. The big three every web developer knows. If you meet a web developer that doesn't know those 3, they're most likely a designer that "codes". Nothing wrong with that, but that's not why we're here.</p>
				<p>HTML and CSS are simple initially. Don't get me wrong, cause CSS gets complicated quick. But you can do 90% of your CSS writing after learning the syntax. See below for an example.</p>
				<h4>My favorite resources:</h4>
				<p><a href="https://wesbos.com/" target="_blank">Wes Bos</a> - The coolest canadian dev. Check out his JavaScript30 challenge. He's got free and paid content. I learned React mostly from him.</p>
				<p><a href="https://leveluptutorials.com">Level Up Tutorials/Scott Tolinski</a> - Love this guy, him and Wes Bos have the <strike>lamest</strike> coolest podcast called <a href="https://syntax.fm/" target="_blank">Syntax.fm</a>. Pretty much for nerds only.</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/derekbanas/" target="_blank">Derek Banas</a> - Great reference to get a good overview of syntax for languages. You might not learn much, but man, getting an overview of a language in an hour chunk is fantastic. Search HTML, JavaScript, CSS etc. </p>
